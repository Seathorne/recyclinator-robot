Attached is a program to do wall following (also on the Recyclinator desk top). 

  In order for it to work, three constants need to be set.
   1.  Kp - the proportional constant
   2.  Kd - the derivative constant
   3.  maxSpeedDiff - this sets the maximum correction possible.

    I have not included the integral component, which is not needed.

  I have initial settings at:  Kp = 0.1, Kd = 0, and maxSpeedDiff = 10

  I suggest starting with Kd = 0 and experimenting with Kp until oscillations are minimized;
then add Kd, which will be 5 - 10 times larger than Kp, for this application.

The speed units are 0 to 255, with 128 being stop, values >128 are forward, and values < 128 are reverse.

 I suggest starting with a wall distance of 60 cm (presently in the code).  Be prepared to use the transmitter
to stop the robot if it behaves wildly or is about to collide with a wall, or any other object.

 Meet with me if you'd like an explanation of PD control.  Attached is a brief overview.
