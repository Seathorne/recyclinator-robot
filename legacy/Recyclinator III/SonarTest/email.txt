Attached is the code that tests the sonars.  All appear to be working (there were a couple of loose connections).
The sonar ranges are printed to the serial monitor in the order:

 LeftHall, LeftFront, LeftRear, RightHall, RightFront, RightRear   on each line.

The hall sonars are the ones above the front sonars.
